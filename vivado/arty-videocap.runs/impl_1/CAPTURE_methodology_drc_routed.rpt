2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock pt/clocking_ser/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_clk_wiz_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks C and eth_tx_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks C] -to [get_clocks eth_tx_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks C and eth_tx_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks C] -to [get_clocks eth_tx_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[0] relative to clock(s) tmds_rx_p[3]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[1] relative to clock(s) tmds_rx_p[3]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[2] relative to clock(s) tmds_rx_p[3]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay

An output delay is missing on led[4] relative to clock(s) tmds_rx_p[3]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#11 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[5] relative to clock(s) tmds_rx_p[3]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#12 Warning

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#13 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[7] relative to clock(s) tmds_rx_p[3]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock pt/clocking_ser/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin pt/clocking_ser/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ */*SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '12' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
Current XDC: C:/Users/user/repos/arty-videocap/hdl/vivado-library/ip/dvi2rgb/src/dvi2rgb.xdc (Line: 11)
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#2 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ */*sas*/sync_rst_src_b*/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '10' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
